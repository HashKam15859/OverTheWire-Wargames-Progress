# Bandit Level 4 --> Level 5

#### Goal: The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the 'inhere' directory.
#### Username: bandit5
#### Password: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
#### Steps: After entering the 'inhere' directory we need to check if listed files are human-readable or not. This is done by 'file ./-file07', and if the result is 'ASCII text' or 'UTF-8' it indicates that the file is human-readable. The password was located in 'file07'.
